 This Repository contains the main [index.html](https://github.com/austy11/Moringa_week1_IP/blob/main/index.html "html code") file, a styling sheet [style.css](https://github.com/austy11/Moringa_week1_IP/blob/main/style.css "styling sheet")and Image resources to attain a replica of a Moringa School Landing Page. It is then branched to enable publishing using the github pages resource **(g-h pages)**.

 In project statement, these were the set:
## Objectives
	1. Correct use of HTML Elements and tags; p, div, span, header tags, ordered and unordered list tags, img, strong, em
	2. To incorporates a custom-made stylesheet 
	3. Use of least 4 of the following styling rulesselectors
	    • box model
	    • background-color
	    • font family
	    • pseudoclasses
	    • strong and em tags
	    • overflow
	    • borders

	    • Font weight 
	    • Font style
	4. The web page is visually appealing
	5. The project design
	6. The page is published/deployed to gh-pages
	
 A majority of this objectives were made, and this is not the final version of code, as it was presented under the constraints of time. Revision will thus be done to attain a smoother code.

 ## usage instruction
To utilize this code, simply clone into this repository and use a live server to view the content. Alternatively, the code is published on gh-pages and could be viewed there.

## known bugs and workarounds
_In writing and deploying this project, a few bugs were observed and only workarounds implemented(some) but not comprehensively tackled_

Below are the most conspicuos ones.

1. gh-pages not accepting to follow and publish assets assets in directories. Removed directories and put assests in open branch staging area.
